## The purpose of NBA Simulator
You're an NBA fan and like to watch some games once in a while. But as a NBA "Rookie" fan you probably have no clue which team is going to win each night and which player is on which team. This NBA app offers a clear list of all players and teams (including their rosters). For the people that aren't familiar with the players the game averages are shown (point per game, etc.), and for the users that arent familiar with basketball there are ratings of each player (offensive, defensive, and overal). These individual ratings combined with the minutes these players make, will result in team ratings. And these team ratings will be used to simulate games. A user can choose which teams play eachother. The reason for this simulator is:
- unfamiliar users can get an indication which team is more likely to win in reallife.
- familiar users can use this when a player is traded to a team and both teams haven't played eachother yet in reallife.
