I started working on the app at the end of the holiday. Made some screens, and experimenten with ways to implement user login-in/register. I will continue doing that later. Today I made sure that 2 of the 4 API's I'm going to use are in my app. I decided to load and proces all the data in de modesVC and not in the views that it is actually used. The player stats view will have the player ratings. Those ratings are needed for the team rating in the team view, and those team ratings are needed in the simulator view. So by making sure all the ratings are already made by the data that is loaded, all the views that come after simply just have to show them.
