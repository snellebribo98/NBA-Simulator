# NBA Simulator
![](docs/Appflow.png)
## Short description
You're an NBA fan and like to watch some games once in a while. But you have no clue which team is going to win each night and which player is on which team. A user can look up all players, teams, and their rosters. To see which team is more likely to win there is a simulator where the user can select to teams to play eachother

## Technical design
All the way up in the report there is the app flow visualized.

Structure of the app
* The initial view controller is [loginVC](https://github.com/snellebribo98/NBA-Simulator/blob/master/NBA_Score/Login%20%26%20Register/LoginVC.swift) where the user can login or click to register. This view controller is helped by standard Google Firebase Authentication. If the user clicks on the register button it will be directe to [NexRegisterVC](https://github.com/snellebribo98/NBA-Simulator/blob/master/NBA_Score/Login%20%26%20Register/NexRegisterVC.swift) where the user will sign-up, which is also helped by standard Google Firebase Authentication. If the user was already logged in, logged in when the app started, or signed up it will be directed to [modesVC](https://github.com/snellebribo98/NBA-Simulator/blob/master/NBA_Score/modesVC.swift). In this view controller all the data will be loaded from the API's. This will take a couple of seconds and if the user would decide to click on any of the button before all the data is loaded, the app will crash. This is why the first couple of seconds this view controller is showed the user can't interact with the screen. After the data is loaded there are a couple of options
  - Click the NBA encyclopedia button: This button will direct you to a tab bar controller where each tab is embedded in a navigation controller. In the first tableview [PlayerTV](https://github.com/snellebribo98/NBA-Simulator/blob/master/NBA_Score/Current%20NBA/PlayerTV.swift) is shown where all the players are shown by last- and firstname. The cells are supported by [PlayerCell](https://github.com/snellebribo98/NBA-Simulator/blob/master/NBA_Score/Current%20NBA/PlayerCell.swift). When the user clicks on a player cell it will be directed to [PlayerDetailVC](https://github.com/snellebribo98/NBA-Simulator/blob/master/NBA_Score/Current%20NBA/PlayerDetailVC.swift) where are the details of that player is shown. In the second tableview [TeamTV](https://github.com/snellebribo98/NBA-Simulator/blob/master/NBA_Score/Current%20NBA/TeamTV.swift) is shown where there is a tableview with all the teams, which is supported by [TeamCell](https://github.com/snellebribo98/NBA-Simulator/blob/master/NBA_Score/Current%20NBA/TeamCell.swift). When the user clicks on one cell the team of that cell will be shown in [TeamDetailVC](https://github.com/snellebribo98/NBA-Simulator/blob/master/NBA_Score/Current%20NBA/TeamDetailVC.swift). In this view controller there is a roster button and if that is clicked the user is directed to the [RosterTV](https://github.com/snellebribo98/NBA-Simulator/blob/master/NBA_Score/Current%20NBA/RosterTV.swift) tableview where all the players of that team are shown, and is supported by [RosterCell](https://github.com/snellebribo98/NBA-Simulator/blob/master/NBA_Score/Current%20NBA/RosterCell.swift). When the user clicks on one of the player cells it is again directed to [PlayerDetailVC](https://github.com/snellebribo98/NBA-Simulator/blob/master/NBA_Score/Current%20NBA/PlayerDetailVC.swift)
  - Click the simulator button: the user will be directed to [SimulatorVC](https://github.com/snellebribo98/NBA-Simulator/blob/master/NBA_Score/Simulator/SimulatorVC.swift) where there is a picker with two components. The user can select two team in this view controller and then either click on the back button which directs the user to [modesVC](https://github.com/snellebribo98/NBA-Simulator/blob/master/NBA_Score/modesVC.swift), or click the simulate button which will direct the user to [SimulatorResultVC](https://github.com/snellebribo98/NBA-Simulator/blob/master/NBA_Score/Simulator/SimulatorResultVC.swift). In this view controller the result of the simulated game is shown. Here the user can click on back to go to [modesVC](https://github.com/snellebribo98/NBA-Simulator/blob/master/NBA_Score/modesVC.swift), or click on again to go to [SimulatorVC](https://github.com/snellebribo98/NBA-Simulator/blob/master/NBA_Score/Simulator/SimulatorVC.swift) 
  - Click the refresh button: All the data will be loaded again
  - Click the logout button: The user will logout and is directed to [loginVC](https://github.com/snellebribo98/NBA-Simulator/blob/master/NBA_Score/Login%20%26%20Register/LoginVC.swift)
* The API's are loaded with the help of the following structs:
  - [NBAPlayersStruct](https://github.com/snellebribo98/NBA-Simulator/blob/master/NBA_Score/structs/NBAPlayersStruct.swift)
  - [PlayerStruct](https://github.com/snellebribo98/NBA-Simulator/blob/master/NBA_Score/structs/PlayerStruct.swift)
  - [TeamDetailsStruct](https://github.com/snellebribo98/NBA-Simulator/blob/master/NBA_Score/structs/TeamDetailsStruct.swift)
  - How the data works: 

## Clearly describe challenges that your have met during development. Document all important changes that your have made with regard to your design document (from the PROCESS.md). Here, we can see how much you have learned in the past month. Defend your decisions by writing an argument of a most a single paragraph. Why was it good to do it different than you thought before? Are there trade-offs for your current solution? In an ideal world, given much more time, would you choose another solution?


## Make sure the document is complete and reflects the final state of the application. The document will be an important part of your grade.
